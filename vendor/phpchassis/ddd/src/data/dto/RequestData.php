/**
 * Class RequestData
 *  Base class for RequestData DTO's
 *
 *      Note:
 *      -----
 *      1.) With this approach, we can decouple the high-level policies from the low-level implementation details. The
 *      communication between the delivery mechanism and the Domain is carried by data structures called DTOs.
 *
 *      2.) The View is a layer that can both send and receive messages from the Model layer and/or from the Controller
 *      layer. Its main purpose is to represent the Model to the user at the UI level, as well as to refresh the
 *      representation in the UI each time the Model is updated. Generally speaking, the View layer receives an object -
 *      often a Data Transfer Object (DTO) instead of instances of the Model layer â€” thereby gathering all the needed
 *      information to be successfully represented.
